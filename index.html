        const describe = "The inspiration for this assignment came from research that I had done on the impact that caffeine has on a person. In my website I linked a page that takes you directly to the arrticle that I am referencing. Although it does not say specifically that red bull leads to heart issues, it suggests that large and frequent intakes of caffeine can lead to heart issues. As a result for my transition I changed the original slogan for red bull as well as took the red bull can out and replaced it with heart pills.";
