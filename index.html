In my website I linked a page that takes you directly to the article that I am referencing. Although it does not say specifically that red bull leads to heart issues, it suggests that large and frequent intakes of caffeine can lead to heart issues. As a resul, for my transition I changed the original slogan for red bull as well as took the red bull can out and replaced it with heart pills. I hope to use this assignment as a way to emphasize the impact that large amounts of caffine intake can have on a person over time.";
